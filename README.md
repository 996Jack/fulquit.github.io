Hello there! I'm fulquit. An italian dude who makes (kinda) stuff on the internet. 
This is a repository i made for my github page and to put my list of useful stuff on github. 
If you wanna add something to the list of useful stuff, or the microsoft.txt, add an issue, listing the thing you wanna add and a description of the thing.
